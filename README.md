# Inspiration

Have you ever been planning a trip to your dream destination, and then wondered how efficiently can you cover the best spots for you within the limited time that you have on your hands?

Have you ever felt lost? , wondering what to do and where to go next?

Well, we've got you covered!

Presenting AI-Travel-Planner: A web application that provides the most efficient Plan for You.

Our inspiration for this idea came from our numerous experiences of being a tourist, landing in a city and then finally feeling lost, or not having covered much better sites.

## Description

The AI Travel Planner is a Streamlit application that utilizes Google's Generative AI to help users plan their next trip. Users can input details such as the source, destination, travel start date, budget, and duration of the trip. The AI then generates a personalized travel plan based on the provided information.

## Features

- Generate personalized travel plans with AI assistance.
- Input details such as source, destination, travel dates, budget, and duration.
- Utilizes Google's Generative AI for customized Plan generation.

## Usage

To use the AI Travel Planner:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`streamlit`, `google-generativeai`).
3. Run the Streamlit application: `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Enter your Google API key and travel details in the sidebar.
5. Click on the "Generate Travel Plan" button to generate your personalized travel plan.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install streamlit google-generativeai
```

## Configuration

Before running the application, ensure you have a Google API key for accessing the Generative AI model. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your API key.

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

Alternatively, you can provide the API key directly in the application interface.

# What's next for AI-Travel-Planner
This idea can be realized in the real world in a very good manner, given time to develop the software which can save a lot of time while traveling.

We can integrate other services and related APIs in order to make it a one-stop destination for everything related to travellers. We can monetize this platform and build a business model out of it moving towards startup.

There is also a lot of scope of Machine Learning as we will be taking feedback from users and helping in turn to enhance the system and in future can also recommend trips to users based on their previous trips.
